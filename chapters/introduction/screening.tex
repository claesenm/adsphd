\subsection{Secondary prevention of type 2 diabetes} \label{intro:screening}
%\paragraph{Secondary prevention of T2D is effective} 
Studies have convincingly shown that early detection and treatment of T2D can prevent or delay complications of the disease \citep{haffner1990cardiovascular,engelgau2000screening, genuth2003implications, holman200810, gaede2008effect, echouffo2011screening}. Additionally, treatment of early-stage T2D is often relatively simple and cheap (e.g. lifestyle changes) compared to the treatment of progressed T2D, which typically involves strict pharmacological therapy along with the treatment of potential complications \citep{pan1997effects,tuomilehto2001prevention,diabetes2002reduction,zammitt2005hypoglycemia}, indicating the value of secondary prevention.

%\paragraph{T2D is often diagnosed very late} 
Despite its widely-recognized importance, secondary prevention through screening for T2D proves to be problematic, as one fourth up to one third of T2D patients are estimated to be undiagnosed in developed countries \citep{diabetesliga, beagley2014global, american2014standards} and typically years pass between the onset of T2D and its clinical diagnosis \citep{harris1992onset}. In fact, the clinical diagnosis of T2D often follows signs of serious complications, which have developed during the latent stage of the disease \citep{rajala1998prevalence,harris2000early, hu2002elevated, american2014standards}. 

%\paragraph{Barriers for early detection of T2D} 
Diagnostic inertia for T2D arises in several ways. First, the disease may remain asymptomatic for many years \citep{alberti1998report}, during which unmanaged hyperglycemia may induce serious and irreversible development of micro -and macrovascular complications \citep{fowler2008microvascular, beagley2014global}. Second, healthcare information related to a specific patient is often fragmented across individual caregivers' databases, potentially causing situations in which various subtle symptoms of diabetes are presented to multiple caregivers, but the diagnosis remains elusive because each individual caregiver cannot see the big picture. Finally, universal screening for T2D is cost-prohibitive \citep{wareham2001should, engelgau2000screening}, though many organizations advise opportunistic screening of high-risk subgroups \citep{world1994prevention, alberti1998report, engelgau2000screening,american2014standards}.

In the remainder of this Section we will discuss existing screening programmes and the Belgian situation and recommendations.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Testing should be considered in all adults who are overweight (BMI $\geq25$ kg/m$^{2*}$) and have additional risk factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item physical inactivity,
\item first-degree relative with diabetes,
\item high-risk race/ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander),
\item women who delivered a baby weighing $>9$ lb or were diagnosed with GDM,
\item hypertension ($\geq140/90$ mmHg or on therapy for hypertension),
\item HDL cholesterol level $<35$ mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level $>250$ mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L),
\item women with polycystic ovarian syndrome,
\item A1C $\geq5.7\%$, IGT, or IFG on previous testing,
\item other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans)
\item history of CVD.
\end{itemize}
\item In the absence of the above criteria, testing for diabetes should begin at age 45 years.
\item If results are normal, testing should be repeated at least at 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results (e.g., those with prediabetes should be tested yearly) and risk status.
\item[*] At-risk BMI may be lower in some ethnic groups.

\subsubsection{Existing screening approaches} \label{intro:screening-existing}
The Cambridge Risk Score (CRS) was developed to assess the probability of undiagnosed T2D based on data that is routinely available in primary care records, including age, sex, medication use, family history of diabetes, BMI and smoking status \citep{griffin2000diabetes}, The CRS and comparable scores have been shown to be useful on multiple occasions \citep{baan1999performance,griffin2000diabetes, park2002performance, spijkerman2004performance}. 
The FINDRISC score is based on a 10-year follow-up using age, BMI, waist circumference, history of antihypertensive drugs and high blood glucose, physical activity and diet and is used to predict drug-treated diabetes \citep{lindstrom2003diabetes}. The strongest reported predictors in this study were BMI, waist circumference, history of high blood glucose and physical activity. Gl{\"u}mer et al. \citep{glumer2004danish} developed a risk score based on age, sex, BMI, known hypertension, physical activity and family history of diabetes. The German diabetes risk score is based on age, waist circumference, height, history of hypertension, physical activity, smoking, and diet \citep{schulze2007accurate}.
More complex risk scores include various clinical parameters \citep{heikes2008diabetes, stern2002identification, mcneely2003comparison}.

\subsubsection{Situation in Belgium} \label{intro:screening-belgium}
The IDF estimates over 170,000 undiagnosed diabetes patients in Belgium \citep{IDFatlas}. The Diabetes Liga estimates that currently one out of three T2D patients are undiagnosed and that one out of ten Belgians will have type 2 diabetes in 2030 \citep{diabetesliga}. Domus Medica\footnote{A non-profit organization of general practionners that focuses on preventive medicine.} advises against population-wide screening, though it recommends case finding in high-risk subpopulations \citep{wens2005aanbeveling}, for instance via the risk factors listed in Table~\ref{intro:diabetes-liga-risk}.
\begin{table}[!h]
\colorbox{gray!20!white}{\parbox{\textwidth}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Persons of 18--45 years of age that meet one of the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item prior history of gestational diabetes
\item prior history of stress-induced hyperglycemia
\end{itemize}
\item or two of the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item prior history of giving birth to a baby of over 4.5 kg
\item diabetes in first-line relatives (mother, father, sister, brother)
\item BMI $\geq$ 25 kg/m$^2$
\item waist circumference $>88$ cm (for women) or $>102$ cm (for men)
\item treated for high blood pressure or corticoids
\end{itemize}
\item Persons of 45--64 years of age that meet one of the conditions listed above.
\item Persons above 64 years old, regardless of additional risk factors.
\end{itemize}

The Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health (WIV-ISP) reports that screening efforts are increasing in Belgium, but also indicates a need for risk stratification that goes beyond selecting all patients above a given age \citep{wivisp}.

%The worldwide epidemiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus—present and future perspectives Lei Chen, Dianna J. Magliano and Paul Z. Zimmet
% The causes of the epidemic of T2DM are embedded in a very complex group of genetic and epigenetic systems interacting within an equally complex societal framework that determines behavior and environmental influences. This complexity is reflected in the diverse topics discussed in this Review. In the past few years considerable emphasis has been placed on the effect of the intrauterine environment in the epidemic of T2DM, particularly in the early onset of T2DM and obesity. Prevention of T2DM is a ‘whole-of-life’ task and requires an integrated approach operating from the origin of the disease.

%uit \citep{american2014standards}:
%Mass screening of asymptomatic individuals has not effectively identified those with prediabetes or diabetes, and rigorous clinical trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur. In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Europe, general practice patients between the ages of 40–69 years were screened for diabetes, then randomized by practice to routine diabetes care or intensive treatment of multiple risk factors. After 5.3 years of follow-up, CVD risk factors were modestly but significantly improved with intensive treatment. Incidence of first CVD event and mortality rates were not significantly different between groups \citep{griffin2011effect}. This study would seem to add support for early treatment of screen-detected diabetes, as risk factor control was excellent even in the routine treatment arm and both groups had lower event rates than predicted. The absence of a control unscreened arm limits the ability to definitely prove that screening impacts outcomes. Mathematical modeling studies suggest that screening, independent of risk factors, beginning at age 30 or 45 years is highly cost-effective \$11,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained) \citep{kahn2010age}.
