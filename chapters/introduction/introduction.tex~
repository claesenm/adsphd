\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

In this work we explored the ability of screening for (type 2) diabetes mellitus based on Belgian health insurance data from a machine learning perspective. The thesis is organized as a collection of papers concerning various aspects related to this application. This chapter provides some context of the project, both in terms of the medical situation and the challenges in terms of data analysis. 

We will first briefly introduce diabetes mellitus and describe the main characteristics of the disease in Section~\ref{intro:diabetes}. Then, we will summarize existing methods of screening for diabetes that are actively used in practice, and how our approach relates to existing methods in Section~\ref{intro:screening}. The Belgian health insurance landscape is described in Section~\ref{intro:health-insurance}. Subsequently, Section~\ref{intro:machine-learning} contains a discussion of the main challenges of this project from a machine learning perspective to explain the necessity of each aspect of our research. Finally, Section~\ref{intro:structure} summarizes the structure of the text and indicates how all chapters (papers) are related to each other.

\section{Diabetes mellitus} \label{intro:diabetes}
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, which is primarily caused by insufficient insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance \citep{alberti1998definition}. 

In the remainder of this Section we provide a brief overview of various aspects of the disease: the underlying biological problem, common complications and comorbidities, classification of diabetes based on etiology, treatment approaches and finally a simple mathematical model to describe blood glucose regulation.

Type 2 diabetes is considered an epidemic \citep{nathan2007impaired}.

todo: epidemiology

\subsection{Regulation of blood glucose levels}
To allow a better understanding of the underlying problems inherent to diabetes mellitus, we will briefly describe the critical role of insulin in the regulation of blood glucose levels.

Insulin is a peptide hormone which regulates the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates. In normal circumstances, insulin is released in response to changes in blood glucose concentration to prevent glucose levels from reaching toxic concentrations. Specifically, insulin promotes the absorption of glucose from the blood to skeletal muscles and fat tissue, thereby lowering the glucose level in the bloodstream, and additionally inhibits hepatic glucose output \citep{sonksen2000insulin}. Insulin is exclusively produced by pancreatic $\beta$ cells, which are located in clusters known as the islets of Langerhans. 

Hyperglycemia occurs when the regulation of the blood glucose level fails and hence toxic concentrations of glucose remain in the bloodstream. Such failures are typically caused by excessive glucose intake, insufficient insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance. 

\subsection{Complications and comorbidities}
Exposure to chronic hyperglycemia can cause serious damage to many of the body's systems, including dysfunction and failure of various organs, and in severe cases may induce ketoacidosis\footnote{This means the body's cells use ketones (toxic acids) as energy source, rather than glucose.} or the development of a non-ketotic hyperosmolar state\footnote{When blood sugar levels rise, the body attempts to excrete excess glucose via urine.} which can lead to stupor, coma or even death \citep{alberti1998definition}. On the long-term, diabetes mellitus may lead to the progressive development of retinopathy (which potentially results in blindless), neuropathy (which can induce problems like foot ulcers) and nephropathy (which can lead to renal failure). Finally, patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for cardiovascular, peripheral vascular and cerebrovascular disease.

todo: comorbidities


\subsection{Classification of diabetes mellitus}

Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of multiple etiologies and is subdivided into several more specific classes. The primary distinction between subclasses is essentially whether or not external insulin is necessary for survival. The first widely accepted classification was made by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980 \citep{WHO1980}, proposing two main classes of diabetes mellitus:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)}, also known as \textbf{type 1} diabetes (T1D), refers to a condition characterized by insufficient insulin secretion caused by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic $\beta$-cells. T1D patients require insulin for survival. T1D can start at an early age and has a strong genetic component.
\item \textbf{Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)}, also known as \textbf{type 2} diabetes (T2D), results from defect(s) in insulin secretion, almost always paired with insulin resistance. T2D includes patients that require insulin for metabolic control (but not survival) and those that don't require insulin at all. The onset of T2D typically occurs during adulthood and is often a result of chronic obesity.
\end{itemize}
The WHO deprecates the terms IDDM and NIDDM, as their use has frequently led to patients being classified based on treatment, rather than pathogenesis \citep{WHO1980}. Hence, contemporary terminology uses type 1 and type 2 diabetes to denote the main classes of diabetes mellitus. Though our work focuses on type 1 and particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus, it must be noted that more forms exist, such as gestational diabetes mellitus which may occur during pregnancy and then disappear.

Type 2 diabetes is typically preceded by the following metabolic abnormalities:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Impaired fasting glucose (IFG)}, also known as prediabetes, is a condition in which fasting blood glucose levels are consistently higher than normal, but not high enough to warrant a diabetes diagnosis. Some patients with IFG can also be diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance.
\item \emph{Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)} is a prediabetic state of hyperglycemia which may precede T2D by many years. Patients with IGT exhibit raised glucose levels after 2 hours compared to healthy people, but not high enough to qualify for T2D. Patients with IGT present a higher risk for diabetes than patients with IFG.
\end{itemize}
Both IFG and IGT are associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular pathologies, with IGT being more strongly associated with cardiovascular outcomes \citep{unwin2002impaired}. Although the transition of IFG and/or IGT to diabetes may take many years, the majority of individuals with these pre-diabetic states eventually develop diabetes \cite{tuomilehto2001prevention,diabetes2002reduction,nathan2007impaired}.

Finally, the \emph{metabolic syndrome} encompasses the most dangerous heart attack risk factors, which include diabetes, IFG/IGT, abdominal obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure \citep{alberti2005metabolic, federation2010idf}.

\subsection{Treatment of diabetes mellitus}

The fact chronic hyperglycemia may manifest in various ways is reflected in a wide variety of treatments for diabetes mellitus. Treatment of type 1 diabetes patients revolves around timely administration of external insulin, which they need for survival. In contrast, a wide range of treatment options exist for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Management of type 2 diabetes includes several lifestyle interventions: healthy eating (specifically high-fiber, low-fat foods like fruits and vegetables), regular exercise, smoking cessation and blood sugar monitoring and management. Pharmacotherapy via glucose lowering agents (GLAs) is used when lifestyle changes alone are insufficient for adequate glycemic control or when diabetes is already in a progressed stage at the time of clinical diagnosis. 

We will elaborate on pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes, as this has played a crucial role in our work. Pharmacological therapies for (type 2) diabetes may be based on various biological mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{External insulin} is administered when insufficient insulin is secreted by the pancreas. External insulin is always necessary to treat type 1 diabetes but may also be required to treat insulin deficiency in type 2 diabetes. Insulin cannot be taken as a pill because it would be broken down during digestion just like protein in food. Instead, it must be injected or inhaled. \\
        Insulins are classified via ATC code \texttt{A10A}.
\item \textbf{Sensitizers} reduce the insulin resistance that is central in type 2 diabetes.
\begin{itemize}
        \item Biguanides suppress hepatic glucose output and increase uptake of glucose by the periphery. The most common agent in this class is \emph{metformin} (brand names include \emph{Glucophage}, \emph{Glucovance}) \citep{kirpichnikov2002metformin}. \\ % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin#Mechanism_of_action
        Biguanides are classified via ATC code \texttt{A10BA}.
        % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biguanide
        \item Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) enhance the effects of insulin by increasing insulin-dependent glucose disposal and reducing hepatic glucose output (as a result of increased hepatic insulin sensitivity) \citep{saltiel1996thiazolidinediones, yki2004thiazolidinediones}. 
        An example of TZDs is \emph{pioglitazone} (brand name \emph{Actos}). \\
        Thiazolidinediones are classified via ATC code \texttt{A10BG}.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Secretagogues} increase insulin output from the pancreas. The main type of secretagogues -- sulfonylurea (SU) -- stimulate endogenous insulin secretion from pancreatic $\beta$-cells \citep{proks2002sulfonylurea}. Hypoglycemia is a major concern when using sulfonylureas \citep{bodmer2008metformin}.
        The most common SU are \emph{glimepiride} (brand name \emph{Amaryl}), \emph{glibenclamide} (\emph{Euglucon} and \emph{Daonil}), \emph{gliclazide} (\emph{Diamicron}), \emph{glipizide} (\emph{Glucotrol}) and \emph{gliquidone} (\emph{Glurenorm}). \\
        These agents are classified via ATC code \texttt{A10BB}.
        % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea
\item \textbf{Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors} slow down digestion of starch in the small intestine, thereby reducing the rate at which the resulting glucose enters the bloodstream. These agents do not have a direct effect on insulin secretion or sensitivity, but can (i) be sufficiently efficient in early stages of impaired glucose tolerance or (ii) be used in combination with other antidiabetic agents. 
A common alpha-glucosidase inhibitor is \emph{acarbose} (brand name \emph{glucobay}). \\
These agents are classified via ATC code \texttt{A10BF}.
\item \textbf{Incretin-based therapies} use the antidiabetic properties of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), namely that GLP-1 augments glucose-induced insulin secretion in a highly glucose-dependent manner \citep{nauck2009incretin,lovshin2009incretin}. As this form of insulin secretion occurs in a glucose-dependent manner, incretin-based therapies are less prone to cause hypoglycemia.
\begin{itemize}
        \item GLP-1 receptor agonists activate GLP-1 receptors, resulting in increased insulin synthesis and release \citep{drucker1987glucagon}. Common GLP-1 receptor agonists include \emph{exenatide} (brand name \emph{Byetta}) and \emph{lixisenatide} (brand name \emph{Lyxumia}). \\
These agents are classified via ATC code \texttt{A10BX}.
        \item Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors increase the blood concentration of GLP-1 by inhibiting its degradation caused by the enzyme DPP-4. Common DPP-4 inhibitors include \emph{sitagliptin} (brand name \emph{Januvia}), \emph{vildagliptin} (brand name \emph{Galvus}).  \\
        These agents are classified via ATC code \texttt{A10BH}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Glucose level regulation as a state-space system}
With significant simplifications, we can summarize the glucose level regulatory mechanism as a dynamical system that is controlled via a basic feedback loop. This coarse approximation allows us to understand the main mechanisms of diabetes mellitus treatments on a mathematical level.

The system's states are $[glucose](t)$ and $[insulin](t)$ (concentrations) and its inputs are $\Delta glucose(t) \geq 0$ and $\Delta insulin(t) \geq 0$ which enter the bloodstream. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The glucose concentration is influenced negatively by the concentration of insulin ($A_{i\rightarrow g} < 0$) and positively by external input $\Delta glucose(t)$ ($B_g > 0$):
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d [glucose](t)}{d t} = A_{i\rightarrow g} [insulin](t) + B_g \Delta glucose(t)
\end{equation*}
\item The insulin concentration is influenced by insulin injection $\Delta insulin(t)$ and insulin secretion $\mathcal{S}_{insulin}(t)$, which in turn is influenced by the glucose level, i.e. $\mathcal{S}_{insulin}(t) = K[glucose](t)$ (with $K > 0$, $B_s > 0$ and $B_i > 0$):
\begin{align*}
\frac{d [insulin](t)}{d t} &= B_s \mathcal{S}_{insulin}(t) + B_i \Delta insulin(t), \\
        &= B_s K [glucose](t) + B_i \Delta insulin(t),
\end{align*}
where $B_i$ is a normalization based on volume and $K$ is a positive constant defining the amount of insulin secreted at a given glucose level.
\end{itemize}

This can be written as the following state-space system with two inputs:
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{d [glucose]}{d t} \\
\frac{d [insulin]}{d t}
\end{bmatrix}
&= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0                    & A_{i\rightarrow g} \\
B_s K   & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
[glucose](t) \\
[insulin](t)
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
B_g & 0 \\
0   & B_i
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\Delta glucose(t) \\
\Delta insulin(t)
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}

Nature has somehow determined an optimal feedback gain $K^\star$ that usually works (or none of us would be here). The essential problems underlying diabetes can now be formalized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Insufficient insulin secretion can be formalized as $K < K^\star$,
\item Insulin resistance can be formalized as $A_{i\rightarrow g} > A_{i\rightarrow g}^\star$.
\end{itemize}
Both of these effects imply a real control action that is smaller than optimal, directly leading to hyperglycemia. Treatment of diabetes mellitus generally attempts to do one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item   Decrease the amount of glucose entering the bloodstream.\\ 
        Equivalent to $\Delta glucose(t)\shortarrow{7}$.
\item   Increase insulin levels manually by injecting insulin, or increase secretion. \\ 
        Equivalent to $\Delta insulin(t)\shortarrow{1}$ and $K\shortarrow{1}$, respectively.
\item   Decrease insulin resistance in cells, to make them absorb glucose faster.\\ 
        Equivalent to $A_{i\rightarrow g}\shortarrow{7}$.
\end{itemize}

The approximated state-space system also indicates that for type 1 diabetes -- in which $\mathcal{S}_{insulin}(t)$ has a low saturation level -- treatments that attempt to increase insulin secretion or decrease insulin resistance are ineffective. Hence, treatment of type 1 diabetes requires insulin injections which explains its alias of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).


\section{Screening for diabetes} \label{intro:screening}
Diabetes mellitus may remain asymptomatic for extended periods of time.

Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until complications appear \citep{american2014standards} \todo{more refs}. The ADA estimates that one-fourth of the US population may have undiagnosed diabetes \citep{american2014standards}.

\item Testing should be considered in all adults who are overweight (BMI $\geq25$ kg/m$^{2*}$) and have additional risk factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item physical inactivity,
\item first-degree relative with diabetes,
\item high-risk race/ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander),
\item women who delivered a baby weighing $>9$ lb or were diagnosed with GDM,
\item hypertension ($\geq140/90$ mmHg or on therapy for hypertension),
\item HDL cholesterol level $<35$ mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level $>250$ mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L),
\item women with polycystic ovarian syndrome,
\item A1C $\geq5.7\%$, IGT, or IFG on previous testing,
\item other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans)
\item history of CVD.
\end{itemize}
\item In the absence of the above criteria, testing for diabetes should begin at age 45 years.
\item If results are normal, testing should be repeated at least at 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results (e.g., those with prediabetes should be tested yearly) and risk status.
\item[*] At-risk BMI may be lower in some ethnic groups.

uit \citep{american2014standards}:
Mass screening of asymptomatic individuals has not effectively identified those with prediabetes or diabetes, and rigorous clinical trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur. In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Europe, general practice patients between the ages of 40–69 years were screened for diabetes, then randomized by practice to routine diabetes care or intensive treatment of multiple risk factors. After 5.3 years of follow-up, CVD risk factors were modestly but significantly improved with intensive treatment. Incidence of first CVD event and mortality rates were not significantly different between groups \citep{griffin2011effect}. This study would seem to add support for early treatment of screen-detected diabetes, as risk factor control was excellent even in the routine treatment arm and both groups had lower event rates than predicted. The absence of a control unscreened arm limits the ability to definitely prove that screening impacts outcomes. Mathematical modeling studies suggest that screening, independent of risk factors, beginning at age 30 or 45 years is highly cost-effective \$11,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained) \citep{kahn2010age}.

\section{Belgian mutual health insurance} \label{intro:health-insurance}
This project was done in close collaboration with the National Alliance of Christian Mutualities (NACM)\footnote{Landsbond der Christelijke Mutualiteiten (LCM).}. NACM  is the largest Belgian mutual health insurer with over 60\% and 40\% market share in Flanders and Belgium, respectively.

The Belgian health care insurance is a broad solidarity-based form of social insurance. Mutual health insurers are the legally-appointed bodies for managing and providing the Belgian compulsory health care and disability insurance. Joining one of several mutual health insurers or, alternatively, the relief fund for sickness and disability insurance \footnote{Hulpkas voor Ziekte -en Invaliditeitsuitkering (HZIV).} is obliged for anyone who (i) starts working, (ii) is still studying at the age of 25 years or (iii) receives unemployment benefits. Among other things, mutual health insurers are responsible for refunding medical interventions, drug purchases and payments related to disability and pregnancy leave.

\subsection{Health expenditure records}
Our screening system was developed to be based exclusively on basic personal information (e.g. age, gender) and readily-available health expenditure records owned by NACM, without requiring any external input.
