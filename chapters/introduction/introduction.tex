\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

In this work we explored the ability of screening for (type 2) diabetes mellitus based on Belgian health expenditure data from a machine learning perspective. The thesis is organized as a collection of papers concerning various aspects related to this application.\footnote{Some chapters have minor differences compared to the papers on which they are based.} This chapter provides some context of the project, including the medical background of diabetes and its treatment, a summary of the Belgian health insurance system and this project's data analysis challenges. 

This work aligns with the overall trend towards eHealth and the rising use of all sorts of data for evidence-based medicine. Our work is the first data-driven medical application based on health expenditure records and demonstrates the potential use of this data in clinical applications that might improve patient outcomes while simultaneously reducing healthcare costs. Building useful medical applications based on health expenditure data can be considered a modern interpretation of one of the key missions of Belgian mutual health insurers as defined by law, namely to promote the physical, psychological and social well-being of their members \citep{ziekenfondswet}.

To meet our objective we tackled various machine learning challenges, of both theoretical and practical nature. This work contains contributions to machine learning, including open-source implementations of all proposed methods, and a detailed description of our steps towards building a reliable screening approach for type 2 diabetes that can be applied on a population-wide scale.

We will first briefly introduce diabetes mellitus in Section~\ref{intro:diabetes}. We proceed to describe early detection and intervention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) -- the most common variant of diabetes mellitus -- in Section~\ref{intro:screening}. Next, the Belgian health insurance landscape is described in Section~\ref{intro:health-insurance}. Subsequently, Section~\ref{intro:machine-learning} contains a discussion of the main challenges of this project from a machine learning perspective to explain the necessity of each aspect of our research. Finally, Section~\ref{intro:structure} summarizes the structure of the text and indicates how all chapters (papers) are related to each other.

\section{Diabetes mellitus} 
\label{intro:diabetes}
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, which is primarily caused by insufficient insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance \citep{alberti1998definition}. The worldwide incidence of diabetes has increased dramatically over the last century due to changes in human behaviour and lifestyle \citep{zimmet2001global, chen2012worldwide}. Diabetes is one of the main threats to human health world wide \citep{king1998global, zimmet2001global, zimmet2000globalization} and is projected to be the 7th leading cause of death by 2030 \citep{mathers2006projections}. Some key facts related to diabetes mellitus are summarized in the diabetes atlas made by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) (Figure~\ref{intro:diabetes-infogram}).

An overview of the medical background of diabetes mellitus is described in Appendices~\ref{intro:regulation} to \ref{intro:treatment}, which discuss various aspects of the disease, namely the underlying biological problem, common complications and comorbidities, a classification of diabetes based on etiology, the prevalence and burden of the disorder and finally treatment approaches with an emphasis on pharmacotherapy. 
We will focus on type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the remainder of the text. T2D accounts for about $90\%$ of diabetes mellitus patients, but early detection of this highly prevalent disease poses significant challenges to contemporary medicine.
